**Patient Plan (Simple, Clear Explanation):**

"Hello, I want to explain what we've found out about your breast health. The tests have shown that cancer is present in your breast. We'll need to follow the guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) for treating locally advanced invasive breast cancer. This means we'll work together to determine the best treatment plan for you, which may include a combination of therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or hormone therapy. We will discuss these options in detail with you and your family to make sure you understand what's involved and can make informed decisions about your care. Is there anything specific you'd like to know or any questions you have at this time?"
