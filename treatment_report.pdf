**Patient Explanation**
=====================

Dear patient, I want to take a moment to explain what this means for you. The good news is that our tests have not shown any evidence of breast cancer in your body. However, we do need to clarify the confidence level associated with these results. With a 0.7% confidence score, it's essential to be cautious and consider further evaluation.

What the treatment involves:
At this point, no immediate action or treatment is recommended. We will continue to monitor your condition closely and may recommend additional tests or exams if needed.

Why it is recommended:
The decision not to proceed with any treatment is based on our current understanding of your test results. However, we must emphasize that a 0.7% confidence score means there's still some uncertainty surrounding the diagnosis. We want to ensure you receive the most accurate and comprehensive care possible.

What to expect during and after treatment:
Since no immediate action is required at this time, you won't need to undergo any procedures or treatments in the near future. However, we will keep a close eye on your condition and may recommend further tests or exams if necessary.

Reassurance and supportive context:
I want to reassure you that we're here for you throughout this process. We understand it can be stressful or worrying not knowing what's happening with your body. Please know that we'll do everything in our power to ensure you receive the best possible care and are kept informed every step of the way.

It's essential to remember that a low confidence score doesn't necessarily mean there's no issue; rather, it means we need more information before making any definitive conclusions. We'll continue to work closely with you to provide personalized care and support throughout your journey.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We're here for you every step of the way.

**Follow-Up Notes**
==================
